# Metacrafters Solidity Token

A simple Solidity contract to create and manage a test cryptocurrency token with minting and burning functions.

## Description

This project involves a contract written in Solidity that allows for the creation and management of a test cryptocurrency token. The contract includes functionalities to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and track balances of addresses.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you'll need a development environment that supports Solidity, such as Remix IDE
* Copy or Download the contract code into your IDE.
* In Remix for ex., you can compile the contract and deploy it using the Deploy & Run Transactions Tab.

### Executing program

Mint Tokens
* Under the Deployed/Unpinned Contracts in Remix, a mint function button can be seen with inputs of an address and a value of tokens to be minted. Insert the proper data and press transact.
  
Burn Tokens
* Similar to minting, there would also be a burn function with the same inputs. Insert the proper data and press transact to burn tokens.

### Help
For common problems or issues, consider the following tips:
* When testing, make sure to give yourself enough gas for transactions.
* Check that you have the correct address that you want to mint/burn tokens on.
* Make sure to check the total balance supply to not get confused if tokens are getting burned or not.
